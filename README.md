## About the project
This is a task for the subject "Lenguajes y Paradigmas de Programación" of ["University of La Laguna"](https://www.ull.es/), the goal is to get familiar with Test Driven Environment. For that we had to implemented a class that handles food nutrients.

### Update [Assignment 7]
We added a Double Linked List class to our project. For the nodes we used Ruby Struct. We also implemented some Food child classes to work with inheritance in Ruby.

### Update [Assignment 8]
We made Food intances comparable and Dll enumerable to work with modules mixins. We also documented the code using yard.
